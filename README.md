## Markdown Language :

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Iis widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.Sites like GitHub, Bitbucket, Reddit, Diaspora, Stack Exchange, OpenStreetMap, and SourceForge use variants of Markdown to facilitate discussion between users.
**GitHub Flavored Markdown**, in 2017, GitHub released a formal specification of their GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) that is based on CommonMark.It is a strict superset of CommonMark, following its specification exactly except for tables, strikethrough, autolinks and task lists, which GFM adds as extensions.GitHub also changed the parser used on their sites accordingly, which required that some documents be changed. For instance, GFM now requires that the hash symbol that creates a heading be separated from the heading text by a space character.

## GitHub Pages :
GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages’ content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer.

*To create your web site using GitHub, follow the below steps:*
1. create a new account.
2. Create new repo.
3. Determine the repo source and theme from settings tab.
4. Write your code and commit any change under Code tab. 

GitHub provides features such as creating mirrored folders on your device that allows developers to create and update their works then deplying the links on GitHub in a procedure hinted by ACP commands which stands for (git add, git commit and git push) commands. 

More details are available on [Getting Started with GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)

**You Need A _Growth Mindset_ to be a distinguished developer. But What is a _growth mindset_ ?** :thinking:

### Growth Mindset

A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

#### Keep yourself in a growth mindset

>“In one world, effort is a bad thing. It, like failure, means you’re not smart or talented. If you were, you wouldn’t need effort. In the other world, effort is what makes you smart or talented.” –Carol Dweck

_**Ways to Develop a Growth Mindset**_ 

 - Acknowledge and embrace imperfections.
 - View challenges as opportunities.
 - Try different learning tactics.
 - Follow the research on brain plasticity.
 - Replace the word “failing” with the word “learning.”
